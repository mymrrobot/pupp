# pupp
PupP is a password list generator.

Usage:

python3 pupp.py --outputfile [file] [keywords]

WARNING: This creates very large lists because it uses permutations for keywords plus the product of a leet dictionary. It's best to use three or less keywords and a set of numbers. In the future this will be re-written in C.
